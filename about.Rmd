## A cilia database

CilioGenics is an integrated and open source, community friendly database for ciliary genes. The key goal is to combine a variety of cilia-related data, including single-cell RNA-seq, comparative genomics, aggregation of gene list from cilia-related publications, protein atlas, proteomics, and cilia-specific motifs. Gene search is quick and user friendly, and it connects to a page devoted to the specific gene, which displays a variety of cilia-related information about that gene.

CilioGenics also provides a number of resources to:

-   explore the evolutionary dynamics ( the comparative genomics) of each gene in the interactive heatmap

-   explore the expression patterns of each gene (whole organisms in C. elegans, and lung tissue in human)

-   view proteomics relationship between ciliary proteins and other proteins

-   search for the name of gene in each cilia related publications

## Update Policy of CilioGenics

Cilia are a complex organelle that possibly house hundreds of various proteins, and CilioGenics is a user-friendly database that aims to provide all existing knowledge about a gene. An automatic update is introduced into CilioGenics. For example, proteomics database BioGRID is automatically updated when a new update from BioGRID is released. However, since any effort to reveal the full constituents of cilia by one technique or a combination of two techniques is likely to fail to catch the entire ciliary genes and there will always new data about a gene, please help us to update the website if you have new data about a gene(s), as CilioGenics strives to incorporate new emerging data about each gene.
